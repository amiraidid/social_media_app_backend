# Social Media App â€” What this app does

This MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node) social media application provides a full-featured platform for users to create, share, and interact with content. It focuses on common social-network functionality and real-time interactions.

## Core capabilities
- User authentication and authorization (signup, login, JWT-based sessions).
- User profiles with editable bio, avatar, and personal settings.
- Create and manage posts (text, (images, basic media support --> coming)).
- Interactions: like/react, comment, edit and delete posts/comments.
- Follow/unfollow users to curate the feed.
- Direct messaging between users (one-to-one chat).
- Notifications for Messages, Friend Requests.
- Search for users, posts, and hashtags.
- Responsive front-end for desktop and mobile.

## Secondary considerations
- RESTful API endpoints (can be extended to GraphQL).
- Rate limiting and input validation to prevent abuse.

This app aims to provide a production-ready baseline for building a custom social experience, extensible with features like analytics, groups, stories, or advanced feed ranking.
